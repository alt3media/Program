# Housing

Stable affordable housing is fundamental to a strong and prosperous community.

* Implementation of the Social Mortgage concept as outlined below.
* Complete ban on the sale of residential and rural property to non-Australian citizens.
* Development of stronger, more viable regions to encourage the decentralisation of the Australian population to areas where housing is cheaper.

## The Social Mortgage

* A *social mortgage* to be made available to families who do not already own property. Not a loan as such, but the direct purchase of a property by the institution providing credit (private or public) on behalf of the occupants. Repayments to be fixed at one quarter of the household income. In the event that the mortgage must be closed, instalments to be returned net of the interest accrued by the credit institution and net of any renovation costs.
* The creation of a Social Mortgage financial institute (public body) to provide loans in cases where private credit institutions refuse to do so.
* Construction of public housing by state and/or local government, to be sold at cost to families with monthly repayments not exceeding one fifth of household income, with no involvement of banks.
* Tenants in public housing to have the option of purchasing the property the live in, at cost price and with all the rent paid over the years recognised as purchase credit.
