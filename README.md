# The ALT3 Manifesto

The ALT3 Manifesto is a political program for Australia and the times we find ourselves in. The manifesto is an agile and evolving open source document which combines policies and ideas from both the left and right of Australian politics, including Bob Katter's Australia Party, the Australian Labor Party, One Nation, the Liberal National coalition and the Greens. Have a contribution? Fork the manifesto and submit a pull request!

ALT3 Media is not a political party but an agitprop organisation on a mission to contribute to the formation of a real third alternative in Australian politics: an alternative focused on pragmatic solutions in the national interest, beyond the ideological divisions of the traditional left and right.
