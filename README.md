# The Australian Common Ground Program

What would a political program that combined the best policies from all of Australia's political parties, both left and right, look like? We think it would look a lot like the Australian Common Ground Program!

The Australian Common Ground Program is our take on a pragmatic political program located in the *common ground beyond left and right*. This program is an agile and evolving open source document, with the latest version always available online here in GitHub.

ALT3 Media is an independent media organisation promoting a third alternative in Australian politics focused on pragmatic solutions in the national interest, beyond the ideological divisions of the traditional left and right.
