# The ALT3 Manifesto: Economy

* Rebuild Australia's manufacturing base. To the greatest practical extent possible, Australia must not be dependent on international supply lines.
* Australian resources must be processed on shore prior to export. For example, Australia must export high grade steel and aluminium rather than bulk iron ore and bauxite.
* Foreign corporations must pay their fair share of tax in Australia.
* Adoption of both nuclear energy and renewable energy to provide Australia's clean energy needs.
* Halt the privatisation of public assets and renationalise privatised assets. Essential services such as airports, water, electricity, gas, health services, road, rail and port networks, public transport and communications must continue to be provided by government.
* Establish a government-owned development bank.
* Strengthen Australia's bio-security and quarantine laws.
* All government spending on goods to be on Australian products where possible.
* Government must discourage the development of corporate monopolies and duopolies.
* Break up the extreme concentration of media ownership in Australia.
