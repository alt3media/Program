* Australia is experiencing a **fertility crisis** which, if not offset by immigration, could see our population halved by the end of the century. This problem must be tackled head-on.
* Every **abortion** is a loss, to the mother, the father, the community and the nation. Our goal should therefore be to minimise the number of abortions occuring in Australia each year. While free, safe abortion must remain an option, the state must strive to support fertility by ensuring that all parents are able to own a home in which to raise their child, to have stable well-paid employment, and to access quality healthcare and childcare.
* Other factors contributing to population decline are cultural in nature, with relationships today being inherently less stable, children being seen as impediments to hedonistic, narcissistic lifestyles, and a greater prevalence of same-sex relationships.
* A complete ban is needed on Australian citizens engaging in commercial **surrogacy** arrangements, inside or outside Australia. These arrangements amount to a third millenium form of slavery.
