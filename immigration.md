# The ALT3 Manifesto: Immigration & Refugees

* Lower levels of general immigration, to reduce pressure on housing and resources while helping wage growth.
* Immigration restricted to workers with skills in immediate demand in Australia.
* Deportation of non-Australian citizens convicted of serious crimes.
* Greater emphasis on immigrants learning at least a basic functional level of English. The bushfire and Covid crisis events of 2020-2021 demonstrated the problems Australia now has in communicating important messages to a population that uses over 100 different languages. Both national unity and local community begin with a shared language.
* Continuation and extension of policies designed to discourage people smuggling and economic refugees into Australia.
