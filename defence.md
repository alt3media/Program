# Foreign Policy & Defence

Australian foreign policy must always promote the best interests of our nation. We must develop positive diplomatic and trading relationships with all our neighbours and all other nations. 

The world is changing rapidly and Australia can no longer rely on traditional allies for its national defence. The US is becoming increasingly insular and unstable, while China is becoming increasingly militarised and assertive. We need a strong, independent defence capability that relies on no-one but ourselves. 


* Australia needs an independent foreign policy, and must not automatically follow our traditional allies into wars and sanctions regimes that are not in our national interest.
* Australia needs to be self-reliant in the design and manufacture of defence technologies. This is closely related to the more general need to re-establish manufacturing industries in Australia. 
* Australia to only get involved in wars that directly involve our national territories and interests. No more involvement in distant foreign wars such as Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and Ukraine.
* Transfer of ownership and control of all US military bases on Australian soil to the Australian Defence Force.
