# Foreign Policy & Defence

* The world is changing and Australia can no longer rely entirely on traditional allies for its national defence. We need a strong, independent defence capability.
* Australia needs an independent foreign policy, and must not automatically follow our traditional allies into wars and sanctions regimes that are not in our national interest.
* Australia needs to be self-reliant in the design and manufacture of defence technologies. This is closely related to the more general need to re-establish manufacturing industries in Australia.
